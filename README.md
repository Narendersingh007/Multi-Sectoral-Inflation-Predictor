Multi-sectoral Inflation Predictor ðŸ“ˆDescriptionThis project provides a framework for predicting inflation rates across different economic sectors. It utilizes historical data and various economic indicators to generate forecasts for both overall (CPI) inflation and sector-specific inflation, such as food prices. The objective is to provide a quantitative tool for economic analysis and forecasting. ðŸ“ŠFeaturesThe project currently includes the following predictive models:Overall Inflation Predictor: Forecasts the general Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate.Food Inflation Predictor: Forecasts the inflation rate for food products.1. Overall Inflation PredictorThis model predicts the overall inflation rate using a set of economic indicators sourced from the World Bank.DataThe model is trained on the world_bank_data_2025.csv dataset, which includes the following key features:GDP (Current USD)GDP per Capita (Current USD)Unemployment Rate (%)Real Interest Rate (%)Public Debt (% of GDP)Government Expense & Revenue (% of GDP)Gross National Income (USD)MethodologyThe process involves the following stages:Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the raw data by handling missing values via median imputation and standardizing column names.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations such as time-series plots, correlation heatmaps, and histograms to analyze relationships between economic indicators and inflation.Feature Engineering: Generating new features, including the debt-to-GDP ratio and government balance, to serve as additional predictive inputs.Model Training: Training and evaluating several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the XGBoost model's hyperparameters with Optuna to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).Results ðŸŽ¯The final tuned XGBoost model achieved the following metrics on the test set:RMSE: 7.4563RÂ² Score: 0.75212. Food Inflation PredictorThis model is designed to predict the inflation rate specifically for food products, likely using a combination of general economic indicators and food-specific data.Results ðŸŽ¯The model's performance metrics on the test set are as follows:RMSE: 3.3386MSE: 11.1464MAE: 0.7688RÂ² Score: 0.9876Technologies Used ðŸ’»PythonPandas: For data manipulation and analysis.NumPy: For numerical operations.Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.XGBoost: For implementing the gradient boosting model.Optuna: For hyperparameter optimization.Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.Jupyter Notebook: For development and experimentation.Installation and UsageTo get started with this project, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-sectoral-inflation-predictor.git
